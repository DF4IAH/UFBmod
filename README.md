# UFBmod
Ultra-Fine-Business Modulation - Trying a new data modulation to compete with LoRa (R)


## Topics
UFMmod is intented to be a digital Spread Spectrum Modulation for data transfer with Low Power and High Range performance. It is non-chirp based, instead it uses Pseudo-Noise coding sequence.


## The frequencies to be used by UFMmod

### Europe
* 868 MHz ISM band (125 kHz bandwidth).
* 433 MHz band (3 kHz bandwidth).

### USA, Australia, Asia, Africa, Pacific region ...
* sorry, not defined yet.


## Directory structure

### DOCS
* Ideas and concepts of the modulation and realization for an data packet transceiver.
* Datasheets of the used parts.

### HW
* CAD/Eagle schematics and PCB layout
* Libraries
* CAM files

### FPGA
* XILINX Artix-7 configuration files with its Verilog source code.

### SW
* Software used by the FPGA internal soft processor. (not yet defined)
* Software used by an STM32L4xx MCU. (not yet defined)
